### ***Description***

The game I've chose is Block Breaker. Here is how the game should be played:

The game have on top of the screen some blocks and a paddle on the bottom with a ball, the paddle would be used to bounce the ball to hit the blocks and prevent the ball from falling to destroy the block. Once the screen is clear the player wins. If the player let the ball fall before clearing the blocks he loose.
